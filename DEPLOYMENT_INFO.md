# 🚨 CRITICAL CONTEXT: GITHUB DEPLOYMENT 🚨

**THIS PROJECT IS ACTIVELY DEPLOYED ON GITHUB PAGES.**

👉 **Live URL**: [https://sickn33.github.io/fondamenti-quiz/](https://sickn33.github.io/fondamenti-quiz/)

## IMPORTANT RULES FOR AI AGENT:

1. **Always Deploy**: Any changes to code or data (`questions.json`) MUST be deployed immediately using `npm run deploy`.
2. **Don't Depend on Localhost**: Localhost is only for testing. The user expects changes to be visible ONLINE.
3. **Commit & Push**: Always commit changes and push to `origin main` to keep the repo in sync.

## Commands

```bash
# To deploy updates:
npm run deploy
```
